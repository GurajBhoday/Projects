        <span>Converting a car to LPG</span>
        <h2>Do you take LPG into your car? The hardest thing is to get moving!</h2>
        <p>Driving on LPG is significantly cheaper and more environmentally friendly than running on gasoline.<br> 
In this day and age, in which we turn every penny in our hands, it is almost incredible how much money can be saved with LPG. <br>
However, you will only believe it when you try it yourself. <br>
Expensive driving will therefore only be a grey thing of the past for you, 
and you - like most of our customers, will only sigh pitifully: "So I should have ridden LPG a long time ago!"</p>

                <h3>How do we help you choose an LPG gasifier for your car?</h3>
                <p>If you have already decided to convert your car to gas, you have another, equally important decision ahead of you – choosing an LPG system to have installed in your vehicle. 
                    You don't have to make decisions on your own and spend whole days on the Internet. 
                    Just come to us, because only in AutogasLPG we will literally choose "custom-made gas" for you!</p>

            <h3>With us, you can choose from up to 6 brands of gasifiers</h3>
            <p>We offer customers maximum comfort when choosing a system, because the customer has up to 6 manufacturers of gasifiers to choose from. 
                Since we are the official representatives and importers of all these manufacturers in Kenya, we have all of them verified and, in addition to the assembly, we also service them.</p>

        <h3>Installation and service of 6 brands of gasifiers – no problem with us!</h3>
        <p>We offer customers maximum comfort even during assembly and service, because we have 90% of the parts in stock. 
            Thanks to this, we are able to do most repairs immediately and we do all the service while we wait. 
            With us, you will not find a problem with either warranty or post-warranty service, which is very important. 
            Many workshops do not even want to hear about post-warranty service - but we are not like that. </p>

            <p>Every customer is different, has a different car, <br> different financial capabilities and an idea of driving on gas.<br> 
                Before we proceed to the assembly,<br>  we will write a form together with you, on the basis of which we can prepare an offer tailored to your liking.<br>
                We reflect on customer requirements because everyone has them differently.<br>
             We will find out what you emphasize from the point of view of the quality-price ratio..</p>
