                <p>We have informed you several times in our articles <br>
                    that we were the first to convert some types of cars to gas, not only within Kenya,<br>
                    but also throughout the world. We appreciate this opportunity, <br>
                    which we owe mainly to Prins and their cutting-edge technologies,<br>
                    in which they are usually the first in the world. We believe that for you - for our customers, <br>
                    this is a strong proof of our willingness to satisfy the customer, <br>
                    the will to increase our professionalism and maximize the quality of the work done.<br>
                 But enough about us, let the actions speak for us. <br>
                 We bring you a list of the vehicles that we assembled first.<br>
                 We believe that the list will gradually grow thanks to your requirements.</p>

                <h2>Infinity Q50 3.5 V6 225kW hybrid</h2>
                <p>In June 2018, a vehicle from our long-time customer came to us. After the assembly of the Subaru Outback, the Mazda Cx-9, the customer acquired a truly unusual vehicle in our country. It is an Infinity Q50 hybrid. After inspecting the vehicle, we decided to install the PRINS system. Given that the car is hybrid and there was already very little engine space, this assembly was really a challenge. After thinking through all the details, together with the customer, we decided to start the assembly. The assembly was more time-consuming, but fortunately everything worked out and we were able to hand over the vehicle to a satisfied owner. The owner of the car even confirmed to us that LPG was the first in the world to be installed in this vehicle!</p>

                <h2>Opel Astra 2014 1.6 V4 125kW kod m. A16XHT</h2>
                <p>Since we have rebuilt several Opel cars, we have also embarked on this one as the first car in the world. Everything was fine except that when testing on the power bench, the gas unit of the system went away unexpectedly, so we did not know where the problem was. After the completion of the vehicle in the laboratory, where the gas control unit had to be specially adjusted, the vehicle left the service fully functional, whether on gas or gasoline. The car belonged to the owner from ÄŒadca and the remodel took place in February 2018.

                <h2>Mazda 6 2013 2.0 107 SKYACTIV</h2>
                <p>This year we had the opportunity to remodel the Mazda 6 2013 2.0 107 SKYACTIV. We installed a KME injection system in this vehicle. After a more lengthy setup, we managed to bring it to the end and the car was handed over to the customer. In the course of use, there was a need to eliminate some of the shortcomings, which were shown only by the longer use of the car. This is also a tax on when a vehicle with a certain type of direct injection engine is fitted to LPG as the first vehicle ever. Of course, in such cases, we warn clients in advance before assembly, and if they agree, we produce a system for the vehicle. It turned out that the client brought the car to us and we, as a supplier, eliminated the problems and adjusted and fine-tuned the system. Although it was very time-consuming and laborious, we faced the problem and solved the problems. I would like to point out that we managed it thanks to the maximum patience of the client, for which we thank him in this way. Thanks to the willingness of the client, we can mount the systems on these vehicles without additional problems and clients can have these new vehicles converted to LPG. Thus, we can mount similar cars with this engine much more conveniently, since we were able to make a system for this car. Currently, it is possible to mount the PRINS DLM system on this engine and therefore the liquid phase of injection through the original gasoline injectors.</p>
